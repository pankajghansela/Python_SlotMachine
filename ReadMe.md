# A python project to simulate a slot machine with 3 "wheels" 

The user first enters a deposit amount and then specify how much money they
would like to bet on the lines.
You can choose to bet on 1 or all 3 lines and specify the amount for the bet

The slot machine randomly generates a combination of A, B, C, D and checks
if all of them are the same values in row.
If so, the user wins and the winning amount is added to the balance.

The user can keep playing till there is enough balance to account for the bet
